# Object_oriended_programming_projects

Welcome to my **Object-Oriented Python Projects** portfolio!  
This repository features a **modular Business Management System** and a set of **independent OOP-based mini-projects** â€” all designed to apply and showcase clean, production-level object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

---

## Main Project: Business Management System

A scalable and modular Python application that simulates core operations of a business. Built with separation of concerns and OOP principles in mind.

### Features

-  **User Role System**: Admin, Employee, Customer (via abstract base classes)
-  **Inventory Management**: Add, update, delete, view stock with low-stock alerts
-  **Document Management**: Generate invoices and transaction records
-  **Ledger System**: Track financial entries and totals
-  **Report Generator**: Export data in CSV/JSON using polymorphism & factory pattern
-  **File I/O**: Save and load data with JSON files
-  **CLI Interface** for real-time interaction

##  Mini Projects (Jupyter Notebooks)

Each notebook is a standalone OOP project focused on solving a specific business or logic problem.

| Project Name              | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `shopping_cart.ipynb`     | Simulates an e-commerce shopping cart system     |
| `salary_calculation.ipynb`| Calculates employee salary with tax & bonuses    |
| `renting.ipynb`           | Rental system for houses or apartments           |
| `llm.ipynb`               | Simulates a logic flow for AI model decision     |
| `document_reader.ipynb`   | Reads documents and handles validation logic     |
| `agent.ipynb`             | A basic agent class demonstrating encapsulation  |

##  Concepts Practiced

-  Classes & Objects
-  Inheritance & Polymorphism
-  Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
-  Operator Overloading
-  Decorators (`@property`, custom decorators)
-  Custom Iterators
-  Factory Pattern
-  Exception Handling
-  File Handling with JSON
-  Modular Design & Separation of Concerns
